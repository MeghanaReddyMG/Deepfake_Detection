# Product Overview

This is a comprehensive deepfake and AI-generated content detection system that analyzes multimedia content (images, videos, and audio) to identify artificially generated or manipulated media. The system uses advanced machine learning models to detect:

## Detection Capabilities

### Image Analysis
- **Face manipulation detection** using computer vision techniques
- **AI-generated image detection** (GAN, Diffusion models, StyleGAN, DALL-E, Midjourney)
- **Pixel-level artifact analysis** for synthetic content identification
- **Frequency domain analysis** to detect generation signatures
- **Non-face AI content detection** (landscapes, objects, artwork)

### Video Analysis  
- **Temporal deepfake detection** across video frames
- **AI-generated video detection** with comprehensive analysis
- **Blink pattern analysis** to identify unnatural blinking patterns
- **Motion consistency analysis** for temporal artifacts
- **Frame interpolation detection** for AI-generated sequences
- **Compression artifact analysis** specific to AI generation

### Audio Analysis
- **Voice cloning detection** through spectral analysis
- **AI-generated speech detection** (TTS, Neural vocoders)
- **Prosody and rhythm analysis** for synthetic speech patterns
- **Neural vocoder trace detection** (WaveNet, Tacotron, VALL-E)
- **Frequency anomaly detection** in AI-generated audio

## Advanced Features
- **Multi-modal detection** across all media types
- **Learning system** that improves from user feedback
